Projeto Front-end

In the creation of this landing page, the Next.js framework was utilized, with TypeScript serving as the foundation of development, alongside the setup of linting (ESLint) and code formatting (Prettier).

# React Components:

The code uses React components to build the page's interface. Some of these components include Header, Card, and MyCarousel.

# State Management:

-The code makes use of state (useState hook) to store a list of card information (listaCard), which is displayed on the page.

# Scroll Behavior:

-The scrollToSection function is used to smoothly scroll the page to a specific section when the user clicks the "Veja todas as vantagens" (See all advantages) button.

# Icons:

-The code imports icons from various libraries such as react-icons and MdEmail to add visual elements to the page, including social media icons, a map icon, and an email icon.

# Link and Anchor Tags:

-There are links (<a>) in various places that direct users to different external resources, such as social media pages and messaging apps.

# Conditional Rendering:

-The code uses conditionals to split the list of cards into two columns and render them in separate sections of the page.

# Event Handling:

-Buttons and links on the page have event handlers that respond to user actions like clicks.

# Carousel:

-The MyCarousel component is a carousel of images or content designed for mobile devices, and it was implemented using the carousel provided by the Bootstrap framework.

# Style:

-Styles are applied to the components and elements of the page through the styled-components library.

# Responsiveness:

-The page has been crafted with a responsive design that seamlessly adapts to a variety of screen sizes through media queries.
